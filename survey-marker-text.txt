4. FIRST AID MEASURES
If poisoning occurs, contact a doctor or Poisons Information Centre (Phone Australia 131 126, New Zealand 0800 
764 766).
Inhalation: Remove victim from exposure - avoid becoming a casualty. Remove contaminated clothing and 
loosen remaining clothing. Allow patient to assume most comfortable position and keep warm. Keep at rest until 
fully recovered. Seek medical advice if effects persist. 
Skin Contact: If skin or hair contact occurs, remove contaminated clothing and flush skin and hair with running 
water. If swelling, redness, blistering or irritation occurs seek medical assistance. For gross contamination,

Issued: 8 October 2024 Version: 2.0 Page 3 of 9
immediately drench with water and remove clothing. Continue to flush skin and hair with plenty of water (and soap 
if material is insoluble). For skin burns, cover with a clean, dry dressing until medical help is available. If 
blistering occurs, do NOT break blisters. If swelling, redness, blistering, or irritation occurs seek medical 
assistance. 
Eye contact: If in eyes, hold eyelids apart and flush the eyes continuously with running water. Continue flushing 
until advised to stop by the Poisons Information Centre or a Doctor; or for at least 15 minutes and transport to 
Doctor or Hospital. 
Ingestion: Rinse mouth with water. If swallowed, do NOT induce vomiting. Give a glass of water to drink. 
Never give anything by the mouth to an unconscious patient. If vomiting occurs give further water. Seek medical 
advice. 
PPE for First Aiders: Wear safety shoes, overalls, gloves, chemical goggles, respirator. Use with adequate 
ventilation. If inhalation risk exists wear organic vapour/particulate respirator meeting the requirements of 
AS/NZS 1715 and AS/NZS 1716. Available information suggests that gloves made from nitrile rubber should be 
suitable for intermittent contact. However, due to variations in glove construction and local conditions, the user 
should make a final assessment. Always wash hands before smoking, eating, drinking or using the toilet. Wash 
contaminated clothing and other protective equipment before storing or re-using.
Notes to physician: Treat symptomatically. 
5. FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES
Hazchem Code: Not allocated
Suitable extinguishing media: If material is involved in a fire use water fog (or if unavailable fine water spray), 
alcohol resistant foam, standard foam, dry agent (carbon dioxide, dry chemical powder).
Specific hazards: Extremely flammable aerosol. May form flammable vapour mixtures with air. Flameproof 
equipment necessary in area where this chemical is being used. Nearby equipment must be earthed. Electrical 
requirements for work area should be assessed according to AS3000. Vapour may travel a considerable 
distance to source of ignition and flash back. Avoid all ignition sources. All potential sources of ignition (open 
flames, pilot lights, furnaces, spark producing switches and electrical equipment etc) must be eliminated both in 
and near the work area. Do NOT smoke. 
Fire fighting further advice: Heating can cause expansion or decomposition leading to violent rupture of 
containers. If safe to do so, remove containers from path of fire. Keep containers cool with water spray. On 
burning or decomposing may emit toxic fumes. Fire fighters to wear self-contained breathing apparatus and 
suitable protective clothing if risk of exposure to vapour or products of combustion or decomposition. 
6. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES
SMALL SPILLS
Wear protective equipment to prevent skin and eye contamination. Avoid inhalation of gas. If safe to do so, 
isolate the leak. Increase ventilation to assist with dispersion. 
LARGE SPILLS
If safe to do so, shut off all possible sources of ignition. Clear area of all unprotected personnel. Use a spark-free 
shovel. If safe to do so, isolate the leak. Increase ventilation to assist with dispersion. If contamination of crops, 
sewers or waterways has occurred advise local emergency services.

Handling: Avoid eye contact and repeated or prolonged skin contact. Avoid inhalation of vapour, mist or 
aerosols. 
Storage: Store in a cool, dry, well-ventilated place and out of direct sunlight. Store away from foodstuffs. Store 
away from incompatible materials described in Section 10. Store away from sources of heat and/or ignition. 
Store locked up. Do not expose to temperatures exceeding 50 °C/122 °F Keep containers closed when not in

This material is classified as a Division 2.1 Flammable Gas as per the criteria of the "New Zealand NZS5433: 
Transport of Dangerous Goods on Land" and/or the "Australian Code for the Transport of Dangerous Goods by

National occupational exposure limits:

ppm mg/m3 ppm mg/m3
Acetone 500.00 1185.00 1000.00 2375.00 bio
LPG (Liquefied petroleum gas) 1000.00 1800.00
As published by WorkSafe New Zealand.
WES-TWA (Workplace Exposure Standard - Time-weighted average). The average airborne concentration of a 
substance calculated over an eight-hour working day.
WES-Ceiling (Workplace Exposure Standard - Ceiling). A concentration that should not be exceeded at any time 
during any part of the working day.
WES-STEL (Workplace Exposure Standard - Short-term exposure limit). The 15-minute time weighted average 
exposure standard. Applies to any 15-minute period in the working day and is designed to protect the worker 
against adverse effects of irritation, chronic or irreversible tissue change, or narcosis that may increase the 
likelihood of accidents. The WES-STEL is not an alternative to the WES-TWA; both the short-term and timeweighted average exposures apply. Exposures at concentrations between the WES-TWA and the WES-STEL 
should be less than 15 minutes, should occur no more than four times per day, and there should be at least 60 
minutes between successive exposures in this range.
ppm Parts of vapour or gas per million of air by volume.
mg/m3 Milligrams of substance per cubic metre of air.
bio Exposure can also be estimated by biological monitoring.
These Exposure Standards are guides to be used in the control of occupational health hazards. All atmospheric 
contamination should be kept too as low a level as is workable. These exposure standards should not be used as 
fine dividing lines between safe and dangerous concentrations of chemicals. They are not a measure of relative 
toxicity.
If the directions for use on the product label are followed, exposure of individuals using the product should not 
exceed the above standard. The standard was created for workers who are routinely, potentially exposed during 
product manufacture.
Biological Limit Values: As per the WorkSafe New Zealand the ingredients in this material do not have a 
Biological Limit Allocated.
Engineering Measures: Ensure ventilation is adequate to maintain air concentrations below Exposure 
Standards. Use only in well ventilated areas. Use with local exhaust ventilation or while wearing appropriate

respirator. Vapour heavier than air - prevent concentration in hollows or sumps. Do NOT enter confined spaces 
where vapour may have collected. When using this material, use explosive dust handling controls to minimise 
airborne dust and eliminate all ignition sources. Keep away from heat, hot surfaces, sparks and flame; prevent the 
build-up of static charges with appropriate earthing of equipment and personnel.
Personal Protection Equipment: SAFETY SHOES, OVERALLS, GLOVES, CHEMICAL GOGGLES, 
RESPIRATOR.
Wear safety shoes, overalls, gloves, chemical goggles, respirator. Use with adequate ventilation. If inhalation 
risk exists wear organic vapour/particulate respirator meeting the requirements of AS/NZS 1715 and AS/NZS 
1716. Available information suggests that gloves made from nitrile rubber should be suitable for intermittent 
contact. However, due to variations in glove construction and local conditions, the user should make a final 
assessment. Always wash hands before smoking, eating, drinking or using the toilet. Wash contaminated 
clothing and other protective equipment before storing or re-using.
Hygiene measures: Keep away from food, drink and animal feeding stuffs. When using do not eat, drink or 
smoke. Wash hands prior to eating, drinking or smoking. Avoid contact with clothing. Avoid eye contact and
repeated or prolonged skin contact. Avoid inhalation of vapour, mist or aerosols. Ensure that eyewash stations 
and safety showers are close to the workstation location.
