# SDS-Stripper
Script created during my time at argus. Takes the text of a Saftey data sheet and attempts to extract the important information e.g. first aid, hazard classifications
Currently focusing on the backend in order to complete my work task efficiently, but UI is intended to follow this
# USE
Run the main.py file in order to run the program. Change the filename variable in main.py to the location of the text files directory.
Currently only being developed to fit NZ Saftey Data Sheets
# ISSUES
Each SDS is different and this script will not be able to extract data from each one. Error handling is yet to be added, so expect some errors when adding 
files that do not match the intended script.
